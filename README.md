1. Project Overview
Purpose: A tool to compute the interest earned or paid on an initial sum (principal) over a specific time period without compounding.
Formula Used: 
.
I (Interest): The calculated interest amount.
P (Principal): The original amount of money invested or borrowed.
r (Rate): The interest rate, usually per year, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 5% = 0.05).
t (Time): The number of time periods (e.g., years).
Result: The final formula usually provides the Interest Amount and the Ending Balance (
).

6. Examples
Example 1 (Savings): $10,000 principal, 4% interest per year, over 1 year = $400 interest.
Example 2 (Loan): $5,000 principal, 5% interest rate, 2 years = $500 interest.

7. Common Limitations
Simple vs. Compound: These templates specifically do not calculate compound interest (interest on interest).
Rate Format: Users must be careful to input the rate as a decimal (0.05) or as a percentage (5) depending on the specific template's requirements.
